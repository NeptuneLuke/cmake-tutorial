# A CMake official tutorial, step by step

This is a collection of all the steps in the official [CMake tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/). Following this tutorial step by step will give you a basic but useful overview of most CMake use cases.

The folders are organised as follows:

- **step_xxx** is the finished step with no comments
- **step_xxx_verbose** is the finished step with some basic comments about what the CMake command is about or why we are doing it in that specific way

The actual **/builds** directories are not included.
